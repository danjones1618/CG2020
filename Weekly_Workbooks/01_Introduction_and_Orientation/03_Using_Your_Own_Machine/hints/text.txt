If you are having difficulties installing SDL2 on your existing operating system, we have created a Vagrant box <a href="Vagrantfile" target="_blank">configuration file</a> that can be used to bring up a virtual machine with all of the required tools and libraries installed. See the comments at the top of the file for instructions on how to get started with Vagrant.

Alternatively (if you are confident to do so) it might be worth considering a "fresh" install of your preferred linux distribution. It should be relatively straight-forward to install SDL2 on a clean linux install. You might like to consider dual booting your computer (if you are brave enough !) or alternatively, use a virtual machine (such as VirtualBox) and install linux within.

Note: If using a virtual machine, you should avoid using display scaling (i.e. use VirtualBox in 100% "Unscaled Output" mode) otherwise you may experience a reduction in window manager performance.
