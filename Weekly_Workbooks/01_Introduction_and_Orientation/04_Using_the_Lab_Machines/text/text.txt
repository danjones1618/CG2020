As an alternative to getting SDL2 installed on your own computer, you might choose to compile and run your code remotely on a lab machine. In order to gain remote access (including remote viewing of graphics) you will need to use _X2Go_. Full instructions for installing and running the _X2Go_ client can be found in <a href="https://uob.sharepoint.com/sites/itservices/SitePages/fits-engineering-linux-x2go.aspx" target="_blank">this how-to guide</a>. It is worth noting however that the quality of your experience using this approach to development will vary depending on the quality of your internet connection.
